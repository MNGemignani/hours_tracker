# Hours Tracker

## Description

 This is a simple program in PHP, MYSQL and Javascript to track your working hours. 
 It calculates the total amount of hours per month and depending on the amount you should do (`WORKING_DAY_HOURS` -> set in `config.php` to 7.6, change to your daily amount of hours), gives you your plus or min hours for that month. 
 
 The program is set just for 2018, so change it in `plus.php` for your desired year.
 
## Installation

 Clone the repo and run the sql file `hours_tracker.sql`.
 Change database settings if necessary at `core/Database.php`.
